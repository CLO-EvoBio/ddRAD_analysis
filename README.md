# ddRAD_analysis

This is an example of the pipeline that we use in the Fuller Evobio lab for STACKS analysis of ddRAD data.

Here are the steps (there are different markdown (.md) files for each):
<<<<<<< HEAD
1. [Download the data from the BioHPC](./downloading_data_from_BioHPC.md)
2. [Check quality of data and trim and filter data](./trim_and_filter_data.md)
3. [Demultiplex data](./demultiplex.md)
4. [Stacks analysis - Denovo (when no reference is available)](./denovo.md)
